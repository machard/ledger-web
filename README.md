# Ledger Web

Open Web OS for the whole web3/defi on any chain leveraging the ledger devices

## App examples

- https://github.com/machard/ledger-web-catalog
- https://github.com/machard/ledger-web-wallet-btc
- any dapp using https://github.com/blockmason/web3-provider-ledger (soon!)

## Client libs

- https://github.com/machard/ledger-web-client
- https://github.com/machard/ledger-web-hw-transport
- ledger-web-u2f to use when instantiating https://github.com/blockmason/web3-provider-ledger (soon!)

## TODO

- Allow apps to define a worker that the host/top window keeps alive. That way installed apps can run processes in background and also make their data available to other apps. The host/top window api must be limited to the strict minium (apps, devices, notifications...).

- Plug react router navigation
