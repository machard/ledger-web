## App examples

- any dapp using https://github.com/blockmason/web3-provider-ledger (soon!)

## Client libs

## TODO

- Find a way somehow to have multiple apps alive at the same time so that they can communicate together. A possibility is just for apps to define apps dependencies and run the apps dependencies in an hidden iframe at the same time.

- Plug react router navigation
